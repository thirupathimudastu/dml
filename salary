Salary Negotiation for Data engineer
Hi Bhavana,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my excitement about the opportunity to work with Indium Software as a Data engineer. I believe that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of the position and I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to the team.

I am also aware that the salary offered for this position is 5+1 variablepay. After researching the market and considering my qualifications and experience, I believe that a salary of 6+1 variablepay  would be more appropriate for this role. I understand that this may be a significant increase from the original offer, but I am willing to discuss how I can add value to the company and justify the increased salary.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and discussing this further.

Sincerely,
Thirupathi Mudastu
